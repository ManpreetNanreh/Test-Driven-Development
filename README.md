# Test-Driven-Development
This was a practice project to learn the Test Driven Development process. It implements the Graph Interface which consists of an undirected graph. Once a graph is successfully created by satisfying all the rules, the Depth First Search is used to visit as much vertices as possible from a starting vertex and keeping track of all the vertices reachable from that starting vertex. This provides us with a connected component of the graph. After the Depth First Search is used to determine all the connected components in the Graph.
